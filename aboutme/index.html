<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Meghan Tole and I'm a 20 year old Media, Journalism and Publishing student at Oxford Brookes University.<br> I'm an aspiring writer hoping to become an author one day; interested primarily in the romance and thriller genre's (with a little bit of mystery thrown in there for some added fun). <br> I really enjoy spending time sifting through different social media networks and keeping up to date with the news.<br> As a person I think it's important to be aware of the world around us and social media is the easiest way to do just that.<br> Anything to do with art has always been my passion and that's why I'm so interested in typography, especially in print media.<br> The reason I chose the course at university was because I'm passionate about going about things the right way and wanted to understand the industry before entering it myself.</p>

  <h3>My Inspirations</h3>
  <p>A lot of my design inspiration comes from the 90s.<br> Most of the books I've written are based in the 90s because of the fashion and the famous celebrities at the time.<br> As I'm a lover of K-pop the idols really influence my fashion and accessory choices. <br> Here are some pictures this the aesthetics in mind:</p>
