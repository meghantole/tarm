<h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
<p>
  Hi! I’m Meghan, a twenty-year-old Media, Journalism and Publishing Student<br> 
  at Oxford Brookes University. I’m an aspiring writer hoping to become an author<br>
   one day; I’m interested primarily in the romance and thriller genre’s (with a<br>
   little bit of mystery thrown in there for some added fun). I’ve always had a<br> 
   love for books and anything creative and that’s why I was so eager to find an<br>
   online space to start sharing my creations.

<h4>MY SUCCESS AS A WRITER</h4>
  <p>I've been writing for years with seemingly no where to post my short stories.<br>
     In January 2021 I decided to create an account on Wattpad to share my work<br>
     and I've been lucky enough to acquire 1.16k followers and 270k readers in such a short<br>
     space of time.

<h5>WHY A WEBSITE BASED ON TYPOGRAPHY?</h5>
  <p>Parts of my website revolves around Print Media which I’m constantly sifting through.<br>
     I think it’s important to keep up to date with the world’s affairs and to do this we<br>
     have to read newspapers, magazines and books. The way they’re presented to us is<br>
     actually really important and I enjoy exploring that concept.
