Books are an especially important part of learning for children and this is why using the right typography on the front cover and inside the books is one of the most important aspects regarding its success. In order for young people to engage with a novel, the typography must be appealing in order to assist with their development.

To provide stimulation for growing minds, colour must be used right in children's books to help draw them into the visual aspects that the various colourful aspects are promoting. Colour provides a powerful way of learning about the world. For a child, there is little that is more important than facilitating a love of learning. The presence of colour in children’s books invites them to explore the visual spectrum of the world around them and to learn about it in an engaging and memorable way.

When bright/bold colours are used in children’s books, they are more likely to start connecting what they see in the books with what they see in real life. The vivid colours hold interest and encourage the young minds to make associations that will become the building blocks for later learning.
