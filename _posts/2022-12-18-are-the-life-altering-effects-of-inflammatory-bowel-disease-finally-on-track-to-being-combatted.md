Inflammatory Bowel Disease is a term for two conditions, Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, that is often characterised by persistent inflammation of the digestive tract. Recently, treatment plans for the diseases have quickly developed, providing patients with the possibility of controlling the inflammation and therefore improving the quality of millions of lives.

Though not everyone has the following symptoms, they are the most common signs specified by the NHS. Others may include a high temperature, nausea and vomiting, and anaemia along with arthritis, jaundice and painful red eyes and skin bumps.

* S﻿tomach pain, cramps and swelling
* R﻿recurrent diarrhoea - often with blood present
* W﻿eight loss
* R﻿educed appetite
* E﻿xtreme fatigue

IBD is a worldwide problem, with approximately 10 million people living with the disease. It can affect both men and women, with most being diagnosed before they’re 30, however, some don’t develop the disease until their 50s or 60s.

Though both CD and UC are incurable, patients are offered treatments to reduce inflammation in the gut and improve symptoms that can disrupt normal life.

> Oxford resident and ulcerative colitis patient at John Radcliffe Hospital’s Gastroenterology Unit, Charlotte Jones, has expressed her trouble with the disease as well as being misdiagnosed. *“I wasn’t misdiagnosed by my doctors, I misdiagnosed myself. You wouldn’t believe the number of stomach problems that can mimic the symptoms of IBD. It’s awful because it really prolonged my treatment, which was just another nightmare.”*

One in ten people with IBD in the UK might be misdiagnosed according to researchers at the United European Gastroenterol Journal who followed 20,193 patients and 201,393 controls for an average of 5.2 years. IBD can be mistaken for irritable bowel syndrome, bacterial infections, Celiac Disease, food allergies and intolerances, and colon cancer.

After conducting a survey here at the BBC, it was found that 44% of candidates asked were ‘not sure’ what IBD was. Further supporting the claims that IBD is often misdiagnosed, 84% of candidates were either unaware or only knew ‘some’ of the symptoms of IBD, and a large majority believed the symptoms could be mistaken for irritable bowel syndrome (a common condition that affects the digestive system).

It seems a large majority of the public are not educated on inflammatory bowel disease and could be mistaking the warning signs for something less critical. It is important to get diagnosed quickly, to rule out any other problems or to prevent complications that can develop with IBD. Especially with the new oral Infliximab pill being trialled, things are on-set to become far more convenient for those struggling with the diseases.

> A 21-year-old patient that has been suffering from Crohn’s disease for almost five years, commented on the news of the revolutionary oral drug, saying, *“I have only recently been diagnosed with IBD, and though I have found it overwhelming at times, the idea that there are always ongoing trials and studies working to treat mine and so many other people’s symptoms, bring me a lot of peace. I’m glad to hear of a more convenient method of treating inflammation being trialled.”*

CPI, a leading independent technology innovation centre, has worked with numerous pharmaceutical companies to effectively redevelop the drug Infliximab into a safer, further functional and more convenient oral tablet that still blocks the substance in the body that triggers inflammation. This is revolutionary for patients suffering from IBD, as an oral antibody treatment has never been clinically sustainable and commercially available. Millions of lives worldwide, that are suffering with Crohn’s and Colitis, could change with this new drug in place.

Research started in 2018 with a funding of £1.4 million, and now as of May 2022, human clinical trials have begun. In the near future, patients may not have to go through two hours in the hospital for their Infliximab medication, as well as their routine check-ups, and instead, just swallow a tablet every morning.

With this new revolutionary repackage, those who are struggling to get diagnosed, or are late being diagnosed with IBD, will not have to experience the tribulations of the former taxing and time-consuming medical practices associated with inflammatory bowel disease.

*If you, or anyone you know, present any of the symptoms of IBD please contact your healthcare provider or call 111.*
