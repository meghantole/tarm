Type is all around us and it has this amazing ability to help us decide whether we like or dislike something, whether we want to buy an item being advertised, or even to pick up a book of movie just by looking at the front cover. 

We often reflect on the power of the written word, but rarely do we consider the designerâ€™s role in emulating the tone of the word or sentence.

> *Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.*
