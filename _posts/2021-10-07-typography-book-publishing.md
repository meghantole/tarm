Take the Harry Potter book and film series for example. The global phenomenon is well known for its striking illustrated covers, posters and metallic text, and this is because artist Graham Meade designing the ‘Harry P’ font. The reason why the typeface is so famous is because of the consistency throughout the eight films and the US editions of the books.

Harry P is the earliest and most popular recreation of the Harry Potter film logo, which is itself inspired by Mary GrandPre's original American book cover. The use of typography is important regarding this series because of the thought that went into accurately symbolising Harry's scar with the 'P' for Potter. It's weighted, bold and eye-catching compared to the sub-titles which usually emit a softer tone. 

The typography for the series overall was well thought out and designed with the story in mind. The Harry P font is now so recognisable that it's been used for merchandise, advertisements and even shop fronts.
