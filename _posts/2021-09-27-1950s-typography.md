Regarding print media, it has always been known that fashion magazines have been greatly appreciated for their stunning covers, classic layouts and their luxury ads. Typography plays an essential role in a magazines development since it can identify the genre and the target demographic which ultimately captures the attention of the desired audience.

Vogue is arguably one of, if not the most influential fashion magazines of all time, becoming a global phenomenon all thanks to Anna Wintour's 1988 transformation. But the question is, what has made it so successful?

In order to dominate the industry, a magazine needs to be iconic and recognisable worldwide. Vogue was able to exceed the expectations of its competitors with the clever use of typography.

***Masthead:*** 

The typography used in Vogue has had a major role in generating its success because of the consistency of the serif font, Didot. The first words that come to mind when we think of Vogue is extravagance and sophistication; this is all because of the contrast of the thick and thin lines used within the typeface. Didot's timeless look is a result of the mixture between its classic, sleek yet modern feel. It’s bold lettering, usually accompanied by an A-list celebrity, is what draws its audience in and emphasises the feeling of true luxury.

***Subheadings:***

The fonts used for Vogue’s subheadings are often serif as well, which reiterates the crisp and professional sense we get as readers from the brand. However, on some issues there is a combination of both sans and serif typefaces in order to give the cover timeless class as a result of the perfect blend of the classic and modern touches.

The subheadings are usually heavier in weight and bold in colour compared to the background, allowing the reader’s attention to be seized.
